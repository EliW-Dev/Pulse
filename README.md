# Pulse
GTT Skills Assessment - a simple 2D platformer using the "Stuck In A Loop" theme.

## How to play

You have been tasked with deactivating a beacon that emits a deadly pulse at regular intervals.

You have a personal shield that should protect you from a few hits of the 'Pulse'; each hit will weaken the shield, so make sure you collect all of the extra Shield Cells as you make your way across the map. If you succumb to the deadly pulse you will have to start your run again, but fear not, your new shield's power will increase with every Shield Cell you have colleded.
